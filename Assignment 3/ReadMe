Most of the code doesnt require user input to run. The queue portion comes first, with the queue being built without user input and functions execute
without input. The state mapping section comes next, which prints out the pairs and then prompts the user to input a State. If a valid state is enteredm, the matching
capital will be printed out.
The palindrome function comes next, which checks if the string stored in 'char ceckString' is a palindrome. Prints yes if it is, and no if not.
